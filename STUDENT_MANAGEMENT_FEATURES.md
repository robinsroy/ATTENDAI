## Technical Implementation

### Backend Routes

#### 1. Delete Student Route
```python
@app.route('/students/delete/<int:id>', methods=['POST'])
```
- **Authentication**: Teacher only
- **Operations**:
  1. Find student by ID
  2. Delete face encodings file
  3. Delete user account
  4. Delete attendance records
  5. Delete student record
  6. Commit transaction

#### 2. Enhanced Registration Route
```python
@app.route('/students/register-with-face', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
```
- **New Parameter**: `student_id` (query parameter)
- **Functionality**: 
  - If `student_id` provided: Pre-fill student data
  - If no `student_id`: New student registration

#### 3. Enhanced Enrollment Route
```python
@app.route('/students/enroll-with-face', methods=['POST'])
```
- **New Logic**:
  - Checks for `student_id` in form data
  - If exists: Complete enrollment for existing student
  - If not: Create new student + user account

### Frontend Components

#### 1. Actions Column (view_students.html)
```html
<td>
    <div class="actions">
        <!-- Enrollment button (conditional) -->
        {% if not student.encodings_path %}
        <a href="..." class="btn-action btn-enroll">üì∏ Enroll Face</a>
        {% endif %}
        
        <!-- Delete button (always shown) -->
        <button onclick="confirmDelete(...)" class="btn-action btn-delete">üóëÔ∏è Delete</button>
    </div>
</td>
```

#### 2. Delete Confirmation Modal
```html
<div id="deleteModal" class="modal">
    <div class="modal-content">
        <h2>‚ö†Ô∏è Confirm Deletion</h2>
        <p id="deleteMessage"></p>
        <div class="modal-buttons">
            <button class="btn-cancel">Cancel</button>
            <form id="deleteForm" method="POST">
                <button type="submit" class="btn-confirm">Delete Student</button>
            </form>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
```

#### 3. JavaScript Functions
- `confirmDelete(studentId, name, rollNo)`: Shows modal with student details
- `closeDeleteModal()`: Hides modal
- Window click handler: Close on outside click
- Escape key handler: Close modal with ESC

```
