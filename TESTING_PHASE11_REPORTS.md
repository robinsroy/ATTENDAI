**Solution**: 
- Check network tab in DevTools
- Ensure Chart.js loads (should see in Network tab)
- Try different browser

---

### Issue 2: Wrong Statistics
**Symptoms**: Numbers don't match database
**Check**:
- Database has correct data
- Status values are "Present" or "Absent" (case-insensitive)

- Check status normalization (`.lower()`)

---

### Issue 3: Download Not Working
**Symptoms**: Click download, nothing happens
**Check**:
- Browser console for errors
- Browser download settings
- Pop-up blocker
- Disk space

**Solution**:
- Check Flask console for errors

- Check Downloads folder (might already be there)
- Verify file permissions

---

### Issue 4: Slow Performance
**Symptoms**: Page takes >5 seconds to load
**Check**:
- Number of records (>10,000?)
