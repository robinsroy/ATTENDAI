# Phase 8 - Real-Time Attendance Marking - Testing Guide

## 🎯 Implementation Complete!

### ✅ What Was Built:

1. **mark_attendance.html** - Real-time attendance marking page with:
   - Live webcam feed
   - Class and period selection
   - Auto-recognition every 2 seconds
   - Live list of recognized students
   - Statistics display (marked vs enrolled)

2. **Backend Routes in app.py:**
   - `/attendance/mark` - Display attendance page
   - `/attendance/start-session` - Start attendance session
   - `/attendance/recognize-frame` - Process video frames
   - `/attendance/stop-session` - End session

3. **Face Recognition Logic:**
   - Extract embeddings from live frames
   - Match against enrolled students (ENROLLED dict)
   - Mark attendance in database
   - Prevent duplicates (same student/period/date)

4. **Session Management:**
   - Track active sessions
   - Maintain marked students list
   - Prevent duplicate marking in same session

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Step 1: Access the System
1. Open browser: **http://127.0.0.1:5000**
2. Login as teacher:
   - Username: `regina`
   - Password: `regina123`

### Step 2: Start Attendance Session
1. Click **"Mark Attendance"** card on dashboard
2. Select **Class: 10**
3. Select **Period: 1**
4. Click **"Start Attendance Session"**
5. Allow camera access when prompted

### Step 3: Test Face Recognition
1. **Student with face enrolled: "abhi" (S03)**
   - Position yourself in front of camera
   - Wait 2-3 seconds for auto-recognition
   - Student should appear in "Recognized Students" list
   - Counter should update to "1 Students Marked"

2. **Check duplicate prevention:**
   - Stay in front of camera
   - System should NOT mark again
   - Console may show "already marked" message

### Step 4: Stop Session
1. Click **"Stop Session"** button
2. Camera should turn off
3. Session data should be saved

### Step 5: Verify Database
1. Run the database check to see attendance records:
   - Should show 1 attendance record
   - Student ID: 5 (abhi)
   - Date: Today's date
   - Period: 1
   - Status: present

## 🔍 Expected Results

### ✅ Success Indicators:
- Camera starts when session begins
- Face detection works (2-second intervals)
- Student "abhi" recognized and added to list
- Attendance saved to database
- Duplicate marking prevented
- Statistics update correctly
- Session stops cleanly

### ❌ Troubleshooting:

**Camera doesn't start:**
- Check browser camera permissions
- Try Chrome/Edge (better WebRTC support)
- Check if another app is using camera

**Face not recognized:**
- Ensure good lighting
- Face directly towards camera
- Wait 2-3 seconds between frames
- Check that student "abhi" has encodings (5.npy exists)

**"No face detected" error:**
- Move closer to camera
- Improve lighting
- Ensure face is clearly visible

**System slow:**
- Recognition runs every 2 seconds (normal)
- DeepFace/TensorFlow takes time to process
- First recognition may be slower (model loading)

## 📊 Current Database Status

**Enrolled Students with Faces:**
- Student ID: 5
- Name: abhi
- Roll No: S03

- Images: 15 captured ✅

**Other Students (No Face Data):**
- S101 - Demo Student
- S144 - Robins K Roy
- S155 - Sony
- S02 - Robins K Roy
