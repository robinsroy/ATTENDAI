- Match against enrolled students (ENROLLED dict)
- Check for duplicates (session + database)
- Mark attendance in database
- Return recognition result

**`/attendance/stop-session` (POST)**

- Reset session variables
- Return session statistics

### 3. Face Recognition Integration

✅ **Implementation:**
- Face encoding extraction via `face_utils.py`
- VGG-Face model for embeddings (2622-dimensional)
- Cosine similarity matching with 0.40 threshold
- Real-time processing of video frames
- Memory-efficient numpy operations

✅ **Session Management:**
- Global `attendance_session` dictionary
- Tracks: active status, class, period, date, marked students
- Prevents duplicate marking within session
- Database check for existing attendance records

### 4. Database Integration

✅ **Attendance Table Usage:**
- Create new attendance records
- Fields: student_id, date, period, status
- Duplicate prevention queries
- Transaction handling with rollback

### 5. UI Updates

✅ **Teacher Dashboard:**
- Enabled "Mark Attendance" button
- Changed status from "Coming in Phase 8" to "Phase 8 - NEW!"
- Active green badge indicator
- Direct link to `/attendance/mark`

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Architecture:
```
User → Browser → WebRTC Camera → JavaScript Canvas
    ↓
Base64 Image → POST /attendance/recognize-frame
    ↓
Flask Backend → cv2.imdecode → numpy array
    ↓
face_utils.py → DeepFace.represent() → VGG-Face embeddings
    ↓
match_embedding_to_db() → Cosine similarity
    ↓
Database → Attendance table → INSERT record
    ↓
Response → JSON → Frontend update
```

### Key Technologies:
- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, WebRTC, Canvas API
- **Backend:** Flask, SQLAlchemy, OpenCV, NumPy
- **Face Recognition:** DeepFace 0.0.79, TensorFlow 2.13.0, VGG-Face
- **Database:** SQLite with Attendance table
- **Session Management:** Flask globals + in-memory dict

### Security Features:
- `@login_required` decorator on all routes
- Teacher role verification
- Input validation (class, period, image data)
- Error handling with try/except blocks
- Session state validation

### Performance Optimizations:
- Face encodings loaded at startup (ENROLLED dict)
- 2-second interval between recognition attempts
- In-memory duplicate checking before database query
- Canvas-based image capture (no file writes)
- Asynchronous JavaScript operations

## 🚀 How to Use

### For Teachers:

1. **Login:**
   ```
   URL: http://127.0.0.1:5000/login
   Username: regina
   Password: regina123
   ```

2. **Start Attendance:**
   - Click "Mark Attendance" on dashboard
   - Select class (e.g., "10")
   - Select period (e.g., "1")
   - Click "Start Attendance Session"
   - Allow camera access

3. **Mark Students:**
   - Students position themselves in front of camera
   - System auto-recognizes every 2 seconds
   - Recognized students appear in list
   - Counter updates automatically

4. **End Session:**
   - Click "Stop Session" when done
   - Review marked students count
   - Return to dashboard

### For Testing:

**Test with enrolled student "abhi" (S03):**
- Face encodings: `encodings/5.npy`
- Images: `dataset/S03/` (15 images)
- Expected: Recognition within 2-3 seconds
- Status: Attendance marked ✅

## 📈 Database Impact

### Current State:
```
Users: 7 (2 teachers, 5 students)
Students: 5 (1 with face encodings)
Timetable: 1 entry
Attendance: 0 → Will increase with testing
Face Encodings: 1 (student ID 5)
```

### After Testing:
```
Attendance: 1+ records
- student_id: 5 (abhi)
- date: 2025-10-21
- period: 1
- status: present
```

- Add date range filtering
- Calculate attendance percentage
- Excel report download functionality
- Teacher class-wide reports

### Phase 10 - System Improvements:
- Temporal confirmation (require 3 matches in 5 seconds)
- Confidence threshold tuning
- Better error messages and loading states
- UI polish and animations
- Optional anti-spoofing (liveness detection)
- Performance monitoring
- Admin panel

---

## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations:
1. **Only 1 enrolled student** - Need more students for full testing
2. **Fixed threshold** - May need adjustment per environment
3. **No liveness detection** - Could be spoofed with photos
4. **Single face per frame** - Multiple faces not handled
5. **2-second delay** - Trade-off between accuracy and speed

### Potential Issues:
- Poor lighting affects recognition
- Camera angle matters
- First frame may be slow (model loading)
- Browser compatibility (Chrome/Edge recommended)
