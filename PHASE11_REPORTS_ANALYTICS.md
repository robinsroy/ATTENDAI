5. Create Flask response with CSV
6. Set headers for download
7. Return file to browser

**CSV Generation**:
```python
writer.writerow(['Roll Number', 'Student Name', 'Class', 'Date', 'Period', 'Status', 'Marked At'])
for record in attendance_records:
    student = db.query(Student).filter_by(id=record.student_id).first()
    writer.writerow([student.roll_no, student.name, ...])
```

## Statistics Calculations Explained

### Student Attendance %:
```python
total_records = len(student_records)
present_count = len([r for r in student_records if r.status.lower() == 'present'])
percentage = (present_count / total_records * 100) if total_records > 0 else 0
```

### Overall Attendance %:
```python
total_present = len([r for r in all_records if r.status.lower() == 'present'])
total_records = len(all_records)
overall_percentage = (total_present / total_records * 100)
```

### Class-wise Calculation:
```python
for student in students:
    class_name = student.class_name or 'No Class'
    class_stats[class_name]['students'] += 1
    # Aggregate records for all students in class
    # Calculate present/absent counts
```
