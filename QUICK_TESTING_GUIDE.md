## 🐛 Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue 1: "No classes scheduled for today"
**Cause**: Timetable added for wrong day
**Fix**: 
- Check today's actual day (Saturday if October 25, 2025)
- Add timetable for that specific day

### Issue 2: Period cards not showing
**Cause**: Student not assigned to class
**Fix**:
- Verify student's class_name is "10" (or matches timetable class)
- Check database: students table, class_name column

### Issue 3: TODAY'S SCHEDULE completely missing
**Cause**: No timetable for student's class at all
**Fix**:
- Add at least one timetable entry for Class 10

### Issue 4: Attendance not updating
**Cause**: Browser cache
**Fix**:
- Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
- Or clear browser cache
