## 🎨 Visual Features

### Color Scheme

### Layout

## 🔄 Real-time Updates

### When Teacher Marks Attendance:
1. Teacher uses face recognition to mark student present
2. Attendance record saved to database
3. Student refreshes dashboard
4. Timetable shows **Present** badge for that period
5. Statistics update automatically

### Status Logic:
- **Present**: Attendance marked, status = "Present"
- **Absent**: Attendance marked, status = "Absent"
- **Not Taken**: No attendance record for that period yet
