## 🎨 Visual Features

### Color Scheme
- **Header**: Purple gradient (#667eea to #764ba2)
- **Present**: Green (#d4edda)

- **Today**: Yellow highlight (#fff3cd)

### Layout
- Responsive grid design
- Card-based sections
- Professional shadows and spacing
- Hover effects on interactive elements

## 🔄 Real-time Updates

### When Teacher Marks Attendance:
1. Teacher uses face recognition to mark student present
2. Attendance record saved to database
3. Student refreshes dashboard
4. Timetable shows **Present** badge for that period
5. Statistics update automatically

### Status Logic:
- **Present**: Attendance marked, status = "Present"
- **Absent**: Attendance marked, status = "Absent"
- **Not Taken**: No attendance record for that period yet

## 📱 Responsive Design

Works on:
- Desktop (1400px+)
- Laptop (1024px - 1400px)
- Tablet (768px - 1024px)

- Timetable scrolls horizontally on small screens
- Modal centers properly on all devices
